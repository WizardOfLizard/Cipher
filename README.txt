This is the README for the Encryption/Decryption programs in this folder.

*Notes*
-keep all inputs in lowercase, uppercase letters will not be accounted or converted
-spaces, numbers, and other characters will be skipped and ignored by the program

*Instructions*
1) Edit the file encoding.html to select whether you are decoding or encoding a message
	-Between the <body></body> tags, there are two tags: <script src="encoding.js"></script> and <!--<script src="decoding.js"></script>-->
	-One of these tags MUST be surrounded in <!-- and -->
	-If you want to encode, surround the <script src="decoding.js"></script> in the brackets.
	-If you want to decode, surround the <script src="encoding.js"></script> in the brackets.
2) Input the message you wish to encode/decode into the code
	-Open the file corresponding to what you want to do (encoding.js to encode, decoding.js for decoding)
	-Edit that file's variable "message" to whatever string of characters you want to encode/decode
	-*Important* Do NOT include a " in the string of characters, it will break the program
	-The variable is: let message = ""
	-Save the file
3) Open the html file on chrome (or any web browser)
	-Right-click the white space of the tab
	-Select 'Inspect'
	-Go to the tabs of the sidebar and select 'console'
	-The text appearing in the console is the encoded/decoded message

There you go, enjoy!
